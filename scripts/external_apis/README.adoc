NUT external API integration scripts
====================================

These directories hold scripts that integrate NUT with external APIs
not yet natively supported.  These may include Rest APIs, Web-based JSON,
or any other protocol that doesn't have a supported subdriver.  They
a useful both for adding the integration to an existing install, or
as a starting point for creating new integrations.

- enphase: web-API based integration with Enphase's locally hosted IQ Gateway.
  Supports web-based login and token management, and maps JSON data
  to files consumed by the dummy-ups driver.

nut - Overview of the Network UPS Tools (NUT)

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The Network UPS Tools (NUT) project provides a free and open source tool kit
for monitoring and managing different types of power distribution devices,
first released under such name in 1999 and following up from a few earlier
projects.  Since then, NUT has expanded to cover thousands of devices from
hundreds of vendors, and to handle various device types (UPS, ePDU, ATS/STS,
solar, blade server IPMI as a sort of PDU for the blades, etc.) all with
a consistent API and data model, which has since been published as
link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9271[The "UPS management
protocol", Informational RFC 9271].

While the project is in active development to support ever newer devices and
their firmwares, as well as operating system releases, one of the internally
recognized goals is to remain compatible with the systems NUT could have been
once deployed on: even if vendors of those boxes and operating systems no
longer exist, the venerable hardware deserves to be still protected with
new UPS devices.

Although the original development involved POSIX-compliant operating systems,
over time NUT for Windows support was also implemented (however as of NUT
release v2.8.3, it remains not 100% complete) so it is possible to run the
whole server and client stack as native Windows programs.

Most operating systems deliver NUT as packages built from a certain release,
which for the project is just a better-tested snapshot of on-going development.
Some OS distribution maintainers pick fixes from later releases to update
their software packages while nominally remaining on the same base line
version that the distribution's major release originally went with. This
allows to balance delivering stable programs with well-known qualities
and minimal downsides for a long stretch of time, but misses out on new
capabilities, features (and yes, new bugs) which the on-going development
regularly adds to the current code base du-jour.

As such, NUT community support for releases (or any other non-current code)
is generally limited to suggestions based on experience, but any fixes happen
on the main development branch (there are no release-tracking branches to port
such solutions into), and custom builds of NUT would be required to apply
them in an end-user environment.  This workflow is highly automated in the
project code base (its recipes and scripts), and the packaged dependencies
or toolkits needed for a build are documented for numerous platforms (see
links at the end of this page).

Thanks to this, the NUT project is also a wider open-source community leader
and reference in the area of build recipes and testing automation for
low-level multi-platform Autotools/C/C++ projects in general.

NUT Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project follows a multi-tiered architecture which may seem a bit complex,
but allows for flexibility with very different real-life setups to handle.
In practice, this involves numerous programs (and their configuration files)
running on the same or different systems (the "network" part in the name).

NUT Drivers
^^^^^^^^^^^

The lowest tier comprises 'NUT drivers', which are programs that can talk a
particular protocol over certain media.  Some protocols follow an industry
standard (like USB HID or SNMP), or are dialects of a de-facto standard (like
the originally Megatec "Q*" family of protocols used by many other vendors),
but many others are vendor-specific.  Some devices support several media
connection types (e.g. Serial and/or USB ports, and/or SNMP for networked
management), so there may be several suitable NUT drivers to choose from.

The NUT drivers are responsible for translation between NUT standard data
point or instant command names and whatever strings need to be pulled for
that particular device.  The data is exposed to other programs on the same
machine following the 'NUT Driver/Server Socket Protocol', which relies on
operating system access controls for the UNIX local socket file or a Windows
named pipe.

For each monitored power distribution device, a NUT driver instance should
be running on a machine that has a communication link to that device.

NOTE: There is currently no support for "multiplexing" information or commands
for devices with multiple-media/multiple-driver access, e.g. to gain redundant
connection or a better data collection than any one driver provides. For some
devices it may be possible to run several drivers independently (probably for
your monitoring system to cherry-pick data points from one driver or another),
while others might only enable any one link exclusively.

NUT Data Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A 'NUT Data Server' (linkman:upsd[8]) represents one or more NUT drivers that
run on the same machine as itself, to provide networked access to their data
or pass around the instant command requests and replies.

On one side the data server connects to one or more UNIX local socket files
or Windows named pipes (one for each running driver), and on another side it
listens on the TCP/IP network (port '3493' by default) to communicate with
local or remote client programs.  It is also responsible for communication
security for driver access, whether by defining the NUT user account names
and assigned protocol access permissions (for value-setting or commands;
read access is anonymous), or by handling the TLS/SSL part where enabled.

NUT Clients
^^^^^^^^^^^

Practical work visible to end-users is done by a multitude of 'NUT clients',
many of which are delivered by the project itself and more are created and
maintained by the community at large.  Some standard clients of note include:

* linkman:upsmon[1] is a daemon to monitor primarily the states of UPSes
  (as opposed to other device types that NUT can handle) which power some
  power source units of this particular system, and based on how many PSUs
  are required for the system to run -- initiates a local shutdown when too
  many UPSes are not in a healthy condition.  Instances of this client allow
  a single UPS powering a whole rack or desk of computers to be seen by each
  of them (through a data server running on one of them, on a machine actually
  connected to the UPS -- the "primary" system).
+
NUT deployments which desire higher-fidelity control (e.g. different systems
  shutting down after different time spent on battery) often couple `upsmon`
  with linkman:upssched[1].
+
The "primary" system is usually also responsible for commanding the managed
  UPS to shut itself down and power up when the "wall power" returns (or to
  reset the load if it is already back), subject to UPS hardware capabilities.
  Most client integrations also stall the ultimate reboot/power-off of their
  machine, if its shut down was triggered by `upsmon`, and reboot after a
  long delay (if the machine is still alive).
  This combined approach allows to avoid the "power race condition", when
  systems would otherwise remain shut down indefinitely (until someone comes
  and reboots them) just because external power returned when the shut down
  spree had already started.
* linkman:upsc[1] is a command-line client for anonymous read-only access,
  used to list devices served by a NUT data server, or to query data points
  reported by a particular device.
* linkman:NUT-Monitor[1] is a GUI client for read-only or read-write access.
* A suite of CGI clients can run on a web server like Apache or nginx to
  provide a simple HTML interface to your devices.

Many monitoring systems integrate with NUT (and through it -- with a varied
assortment of power devices), using either simple clients like `upsc` or
`upslog`, or libraries and bindings provided by the project itself (e.g.
C, C++, Python, Java in a nearby repository) or by third-party efforts
(e.g. Perl, Go, C#, REST API).

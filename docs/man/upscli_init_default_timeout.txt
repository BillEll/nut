UPSCLI_INIT_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT(3)
==============================

NAME
----

upscli_init_default_timeout - Initialize upsclient module aspect of default timeout.

SYNOPSIS
--------

------
	#include <upsclient.h>

	int upscli_init_default_timeout(
		const char *cli_secs,
		const char *config_secs,
		const char *default_secs);
------

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *upscli_init_default_timeout()* function initializes upsclient module
aspect of default connection timeout for linkman:upscli_connect[3], populating
the value from different sources, mostly C strings which represent a
floating-point non-negative number (invalid parsing is logged and may impact
the return value), any or all of them may be `NULL` to skip, and in specific
order (last valid hit wins):

* built-in '0' meaning indefinitely blocking (NUT default for this method over
  at least 20 years);
* the number from `default_secs` as a particular NUT or third-party client
  program's built-in preferred (low-priority) default;
* the number from `NUT_DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` environment variable as a
  site-local preference (generally pre-set in linkman:nut.conf[5]);
* the number from `config_secs` as a particular NUT or third-party client
  program's configuration file default;
* the number from `cli_secs` as a particular NUT or third-party client
  program's setting from command line (highest priority).

Internally, calls linkman:upscli_set_default_timeout[3] for most of the string
related processing.

RETURN VALUE
------------

The *upscli_init_default_timeout()* function returns '0' on success (either if
all strings were `NULL` so the built-in default is applied, or at least one of
those strings that were set was valid and its value got applied), or '-1' if
an error occurs (at least one string was not `NULL`, and none of the strings
was valid).

NUT Quality Assurance Guide
===========================
:Author: Jim_Klimov
:Author Initials: JK

WARNING: This is a Work In Progress document.

Abstract
--------

The aim of this document is to describe the different ways we ensure and
maintain the source code quality of Network UPS Tools, its portability to
various platforms, and non-regression.

Previous NUT releases may have included parts of this documentation in the
developer guide or user manual. Most of this information can be applied to
both automated testing environments and local development workflows.

[[CI_Farm_Notes]]
CI Farm configuration notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: This chapter contains information about NUT CI farm setup tricks
that were applied at different times by the maintainer team to ensure
regular builds and tests of the codebase.  Whether these are used in
daily production today or not, similar setup should be possible locally
on developer and contributor machines.

Multiple FOSS CI providers and technologies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While there are many FOSS-friendly CI offerings, they are usually (and
reasonably) focused on the OS market leaders -- offering recent releases
of Linux, Windows and MacOS build agents, and sometimes a way to "bring
your own device" to cover other systems.  The NUT CI farm does benefit
from those offerings as well, using GitHub Actions with CodeQL for Linux
code quality inspection, AppVeyor CI for Windows, and CircleCI for MacOS,
to name a few.

But on the other hand, being a massively multi-platform effort (and aiming
to support older boxes that are still alive even if their vendors and/or
distro versions are not), a comprehensive NUT CI approach requires many
machines running uncommon operating systems.  This is where custom virtual
machines help, and more so -- a core set of those hosted in the cloud and
dedicated to the project, rather than only some resources intermittently
contributed by community members which come and go.

NOTE: Community-provided builders running on further systems are also
welcome, and the option is of course supported, as managed by the
link:https://github.com/networkupstools/jenkins-dynamatrix[Jenkins-Dynamatrix]
effort which appeared due to such need, and runs the core NUT CI farm.

We have also had historic experience with FOSS CI providers (and community
members' machines) disappearing, so having NUT CI farm goals covered by
multiple independent implementations is also a feature beyond having yet
another set of digital eyes looking at our code quality (which is also a
goal in itself).

Jenkins is the way

[[CI_LXC]]
Custom NUT CI farm build agents: LXC containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section details configuration of LXC containers as build environments
for NUT CI farm; this approach can also be used on developer workstations.

/////////////////////
// Note: while docs recommend relative offsets or using them as parameters
// to the include macro, this is a feature of asciidoctor - not asciidoc-py
// (older implementation) that we rely on in most operating systems:
// https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/include-with-leveloffset/
//
// So we resort to absolute offsets (as explicitly not recommended) in the
// document itself, that `Title.level` handling in the older code base supports:
// https://github.com/asciidoc-py/asciidoc-py/blob/main/asciidoc/asciidoc.py#L1775
